# Intro to R Markdown

* __R Markdown__ is an implementation of the _Markdown_ markup language 

* Markdown is a versatile tool that makes it easy to make readable scientific documents in a variety of formats

* R markdown is actively developed and supported by the RStudio team, which means:

  + RStudio has many tools and features to make R Markdown flexible and easy to use

  + New R Markdown features and packages are frequently released

# Intro to R Markdown

* __R For Data Science__ on the intent of R Markdown:

_R Markdown files are designed to be used in three ways:_

1. _For communicating to decision makers, who want to focus on the conclusions, not the code behind the analysis._

2. _For collaborating with other data scientists (including future you!), who are interested in both your conclusions, and how you reached them (i.e. the code)._

3. _As an environment in which to do data science, as a modern day lab notebook where you can capture not only what you did, but also what you were thinking._

# Required Packages

* `ggplot2`

* `tidyverse`

* `knitr`

* `stargazer`

* `png`

# Presentations

- You can easily create academic presentations using 4 different formats

    + beamer (pdf)
    
    + ioslides (html)
    
    + slidy (html)
    
    + xaringan (html)

# knitr

- R Markdown can make full use of Latex through the `knitr` package

- `knitr` lets you easily display mathematical formulas and other Latex formatting in your Markdown document

- For example, math can be inserted inline like `\(\alpha^2 + \beta^2 = \gamma^2\)` or in display mode:

`$$Y = X \beta + \varepsilon$$`

`$$\int_{\mathbb{R}} \sum_{i = 1}^n \nabla \ell_i d\mu$$`
